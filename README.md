# TravelBPHCv2
A website where people can find other people traveling from Place A to Place B (was initially airport to campus and back.), basically to carpool. 

We can: 
- Create Requests with a number of people with you on others' posts if you want to travel with them.
- See details of people who requested on our posts and either Accept or Reject the carpool request.
- See which of our requests were accepted or rejected on the homepage.
- Setpoints on the map for Pickup and Dropoff locations. 
- Check all posts or filter them based on location (within a radius of 2km), or based on the name or date.
- Check the ideal route which one should take for every post in the "All Posts" section
- Scroll down on the route page, and click the start button to start a journey from your current location to the destination. 
- Login using Google OAuth where only BITSmail is allowed.
